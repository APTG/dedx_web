# Implementer Subagent — dEdx Web

This file documents the `implementer` subagent defined in `opencode.json`.
It is a human-readable reference; the active prompt is in the `agent.implementer.prompt`
field of `opencode.json`.

---

## Role

Receives ONE atomic task from the orchestrating main agent. Writes code, tests, and
commits autonomously. Never asks for clarification mid-task.

## Model

`Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8` — largest available model on PLGrid; used for best
code quality and adherence to the strict Svelte 5 / TypeScript rules.

## Input contract

The main agent calls this subagent with a message in the form:

```
Task: <one-line task name>
Spec section: <path and section heading in docs/04-feature-specs/>
Branch: <current git branch>
Acceptance criteria:
- criterion 1
- criterion 2
```

## Output contract

The final message must be EXACTLY one of:

```
TASK DONE: <task name>
```

or

```
TASK BLOCKED: <one-sentence reason>
```

No other final output is acceptable. The main agent parses these signals to decide
whether to move to the reviewer or to retry.

## Non-negotiable rules

> **Single source of truth:** AGENTS.md §2 (Svelte 5 runes only) and the
> "Code Style" / "Build & Test Commands" sections. The implementer must read
> AGENTS.md before writing code. The lists below are short reminders; if they
> ever drift from AGENTS.md, **AGENTS.md wins**.

### Svelte 5 — runes only (reminder, see AGENTS.md §2 for full table)

| Use                                                    | Never use                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`, `$props`, `$bindable` | `export let`, `$:`                    |
| `$effect` for side effects and lifecycle               | `onMount` / `onDestroy` from `svelte` |
| Module-level fine-grained reactivity                   | `svelte/store` subscriptions          |
| `{@render snippet()}`                                  | `<slot>`                              |
| `onclick={handler}`                                    | `on:click={handler}`                  |

Run `svelte-autofixer` (via the Svelte MCP tool) on every `.svelte` file before
committing. Fix all reported issues.

### Svelte 5 — effect self-dependency prevention (CRITICAL)

`effect_update_depth_exceeded` is the most common runaway-loop in Svelte 5.
It occurs when a `$effect` **reads** a reactive signal that it also **writes**.

**Rule: NEVER read a reactive `$state` variable inside a `$effect` after writing to it.**

Two safe patterns:

```ts
// ✅ SAFE: initialize through a local variable, assign to reactive signal ONCE at the end
$effect(() => {
  const newState = createFoo(); // local variable — no reactive signal read
  newState.setX(1); // safe — reads/writes only the local var
  newState.setY(2); // safe
  myState = newState; // ONE write to the reactive signal, at the very end
});

// ✅ SAFE: use untrack() to break a dependency you need to pass through but not react to
$effect(() => {
  const next = computeUrl(myValue); // reactive read: myValue
  untrack(() => replaceState(next, page.state)); // page.state read is NOT a dependency
});
```

```ts
// ❌ WRONG: reading myState.foo after writing myState → self-dependency → infinite loop
$effect(() => {
  myState = createFoo();
  myState.setX(1); // reads outer reactive myState — registers a dependency on it!
  myState.setY(2); // same problem
});
```

Additional pitfalls:

- `replaceState(url, page.state)` inside a URL-sync `$effect`: wrap in `untrack()`.
  `page.state` is reactive; `replaceState` updates it; without `untrack` the effect
  re-fires every time it runs, creating a loop.
- Reading `page.url.searchParams` inside a creation `$effect` while also calling
  `replaceState` elsewhere: use `new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)` instead
  (non-reactive DOM API).

### TypeScript

- `tsconfig.json` uses `"strict": true` — honour it.
- No `any` except at WASM boundaries; must be accompanied by an explicit cast comment.
- All component props typed via `$props()` with an explicit interface.

### File locations

| Code type                  | Location                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reusable UI components     | `src/lib/components/`                                   |
| Business logic / state     | `src/lib/state/`                                        |
| Utilities (pure functions) | `src/lib/utils/`                                        |
| WASM wrapper               | `src/lib/wasm/libdedx.ts` — do not modify the interface |
| Page-specific components   | `src/routes/<page>/`                                    |

### Testing

- Vitest unit tests for all business logic functions.
- Svelte component tests (`@testing-library/svelte`) for interactive behaviour.
- Mock `LibdedxService` — never depend on real WASM in unit tests.
- Every acceptance criterion from the task must have at least one test.

### E2E tests (MANDATORY — do not skip)

**Always run `pnpm exec playwright test` as part of the workflow.** A task is not
done until the E2E suite either passes or the failures are confirmed pre-existing.

If the WASM binary is absent (`static/wasm/libdedx.mjs` missing), E2E tests that
require WASM should be marked `test.skip` with the comment
`// Skipped when WASM binary absent. CI downloads artifact before running E2E.`

**Do not skip the `pnpm exec playwright test` command itself.** Even with skipped
tests the command must run cleanly (exit 0 with all skipped / passed).

If `pnpm exec playwright test` produces failures:

1. Read the failure output carefully — do not assume failures are pre-existing.
2. Check whether any new test you wrote caused an existing test to regress.
3. Fix failures caused by your own changes before outputting `TASK DONE`.
4. If a failure is pre-existing (existed before your task), document it explicitly
   in the `TASK DONE` message.

#### E2E test timeouts — CRITICAL

The E2E suite runs against the real compiled app with WASM. WASM loading, reactive
effects settling, and debounce delays can all take time. **Never use hard-coded
`waitForTimeout()` delays** — they are brittle. Use explicit condition waits instead:

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: wait for condition
await page.waitForSelector('[data-testid="result-table"]', { timeout: 10000 });
await page.waitForFunction(() => window.location.search.includes("density=1.2"), { timeout: 5000 });
await expect.poll(async () => parseFloat(...), { timeout: 8000 }).toBeGreaterThan(0);

// ❌ BAD: fixed delay — flaky in CI
await page.waitForTimeout(1000);
```

Individual test timeouts should be set explicitly when a test involves WASM loading
(30–60 s) or long debounce chains (5–10 s). Use `test.setTimeout(ms)` at the top
of the test if a single test needs more time.

#### E2E tests for reactive side effects — CRITICAL

Unit tests verify math; E2E tests must verify the **reactive wiring** that connects
UI input changes to recalculations. Without these, a bug can exist where the math
is correct but the calculation never retriggers when state changes (as happened in
Stage 6.8 where density override had no effect in the browser despite correct unit tests).

**Rule:** For every feature that computes a value from reactive state, write an E2E
test that:
1. Reads the **baseline** computed value from the DOM.
2. Changes the reactive input (e.g. density, interpolation method, energy).
3. Polls the DOM until the computed value **changes** from the baseline.
4. Asserts the new value is within the expected physical range.

Example pattern (density 2× → CSDA range halves):
```typescript
// Read baseline
const rangeCell = page.locator('[data-testid="range-cell-0"]');
const baseline = await expect.poll(
  async () => parseFloat((await rangeCell.textContent()) ?? ""),
  { timeout: 8000 }
).toBeGreaterThan(0);

// Change input
await densityInput.fill("2");
await densityInput.blur();

// Verify recalculation fired AND the result is physically correct
await expect.poll(
  async () => parseFloat((await rangeCell.textContent()) ?? ""),
  { timeout: 5000 }
).toBeLessThan(baseline * 0.6); // 2× density → ≈½ range
```

#### Reactive dep registration in `$effect` — CRITICAL (prevents missed retriggers)

When a `$effect` reads reactive state **only inside an async callback**, Svelte does
NOT register it as a dependency — the effect will never re-run when that state
changes. This is the root cause of the Stage 6.8 density override bug.

**Rule:** Snapshot reactive state **synchronously** at the top of the `$effect`,
before any `await` or `getService().then()` call:

```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT: snapshotted synchronously → registered as dep, re-runs on change
$effect(() => {
  const advOptsSnapshot = advancedOptions.value; // ← reactive dep registered HERE
  const inputSnapshot = entityState.selectedMaterial;
  getService().then((svc) => {
    svc.calculate(inputSnapshot, advOptsSnapshot); // uses frozen snapshot
  });
});

// ❌ WRONG: reading reactive state inside .then() → NOT a dep → effect never retriggers
$effect(() => {
  getService().then((svc) => {
    svc.calculate(entityState.selectedMaterial, advancedOptions.value); // ← reads here = no dep
  });
});
```

Similarly, state read only inside a `setTimeout` callback is not tracked.

Also, for multi-page features with a "settings" singleton (like `advancedOptions`),
add a dedicated `$effect` in each page component that reads a key derived from the
settings (e.g. `JSON.stringify(advancedOptions.value)`) and calls the recalculation
function when it changes.

### Commit format

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<optional body — only if the WHY is non-obvious>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `chore`, `docs`
No `--no-verify`. Fix hook failures before committing.

## MCP tool usage

Three MCP servers are available. Use them proactively — do not guess when a tool can answer.

### Svelte MCP (`@sveltejs/opencode` plugin)

Already covered in [Non-negotiable rules](#non-negotiable-rules): call `svelte-autofixer`
on every `.svelte` file you write before committing.

### Tailwind MCP (`tailwindcss-mcp-server`)

When writing Tailwind CSS classes in Svelte components:

- **Before writing a utility class**, query the Tailwind MCP for the correct v4 name,
  spacing/color token, or arbitrary-value syntax.
- This is especially important for Tailwind v4 — class names and layer syntax differ from v3.
- Example: if you want a specific gray shade or want to know the correct `@layer` syntax, ask the MCP.

### Playwright MCP (`@playwright/mcp`)

**This is for interactive browser control during development — NOT for running the E2E test suite.**

`pnpm exec playwright test` runs the project's test files in `tests/e2e/`. The Playwright MCP
gives you live browser tools (navigate, click, screenshot, accessibility snapshot) that you
call manually.

When to use it:

1. After implementing a UI component, start the dev server (`pnpm dev`).
2. Use the `browser_navigate` tool to open `http://localhost:5173/<route>`.
3. Use `browser_screenshot` to visually verify layout and rendering.
4. Use `browser_click` / `browser_type` to verify interactive behavior.
5. Fix visual issues, then proceed with `pnpm exec playwright test` as usual.

This turns the workflow from "code → test → commit" into "code → **see** → fix → test → commit",
catching visual regressions before the E2E suite runs.

---

## Workflow

1. Read the task description and acceptance criteria.
2. Read the referenced spec section in `docs/04-feature-specs/`.
3. Read existing related files to understand current patterns.
4. Implement code.
5. Write/update tests (unit + component).
6. Run `pnpm lint && pnpm format && pnpm test && pnpm build`.
7. Fix all errors. Repeat from step 6 until clean.
8. **Run `pnpm exec playwright test`.** Fix any E2E failures caused by your changes.
9. Commit.
10. Output `TASK DONE: <task name>`.

If step 6 or step 8 fails after two full fix attempts, output `TASK BLOCKED: <reason>`.

## maxSteps

80 steps. If the step counter approaches the limit and the task is not done,
output `TASK BLOCKED: step limit reached — partial work committed on current branch`.
