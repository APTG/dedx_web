## 1. Context

### Versioning

| Version    | Status                | URL                                                       | Notes                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **v1.1.0** | Released 1 April 2022 | [aptg.github.io/web](https://aptg.github.io/web/)         | Last stable release; legacy React 17 app   |
| **v2.x**   | Open beta / feedback  | [aptg.github.io/web_dev](https://aptg.github.io/web_dev/) | This rewrite — SvelteKit + Svelte 5 + WASM |

The first production release of v2 will be tagged `v2.0.0` and deployed to `APTG/web` (see Stage 9).

### What is being rewritten and why

The **v1.1.0** codebase is an outdated, broken React 17 + Bootstrap + JSROOT web interface
for the **libdedx** C library (stopping power / energy calculations), compiled to WebAssembly
via Emscripten.

**Pain points with v1:**

- It doesn't work.
- Plots are ugly.
- Code is old (React 17, class components, no TypeScript, CRA).

The goal of **v2** is a **ground-up rewrite** using modern tooling, driven by AI agents
(GitHub Copilot) with spec-driven development.

| Formatting      | **Prettier** (`prettier-plugin-svelte`)                                            |
| Testing         | **Full coverage** — unit + integration + E2E                                       |

| UX inspiration  | **ATIMA** (https://www.isotopea.com/webatima/)                                     |

> **Svelte 5 only.** This project uses Svelte 5 with runes (`$state`, `$derived`,
> `$effect`, `$props`, `$bindable`). Do **not** use Svelte 4 patterns:
> no `export let` for props, no `$:` reactive statements, no `createEventDispatcher()`,
> no `onMount`/`onDestroy` from `svelte` (use `$effect` instead), no stores via
> `$` auto-subscription (use runes-based state). The `svelte/store` module is
> replaced by fine-grained reactivity. See https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/v5-migration-guide.
>
> **Linting & formatting.** ESLint + Prettier run on every save and in CI.
> Ruff is not applicable — it is Python-only. For TypeScript + Svelte, the
> standard toolchain is `eslint-plugin-svelte` + `prettier-plugin-svelte`.
> Consider `eslint-plugin-svelte` with `svelte/recommended` preset.

## 3. New Features (not in the old app)

1. **Better unit handling** — MeV vs MeV/nucl vs MeV/u, with proper conversion.
2. **Shareable URLs** — encode full calculation state in URL query params.
3. **Data series comparison** — overlay multiple series on one JSROOT plot.
4. **Multi-program calculation** — run the same query across multiple libdedx programs at once.
5. **PDF + CSV export** — dump results and plots.
6. **Live calculation** — results update reactively as the user types (debounced).

---

## 4. Documentation Structure

All design documents live in `docs/`. Each file serves as a direct input
for an AI agent session implementing that part.

## 4.1 AI Agent Configuration (`.github/`)

GitHub Copilot reads customization files from `.github/` to get project
context automatically. These are **version-controlled** and shared with
anyone working on the repo.

```

```

**What each primitive does:**

| Primitive              | File                      | When loaded                                     | Purpose                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Workspace instructions | `copilot-instructions.md` | Every interaction                               | Project context, Svelte 5 rules, build commands |
| File instructions      | `*.instructions.md`       | When editing matching files                     | Framework/domain-specific rules                 |
| Prompts                | `*.prompt.md`             | On-demand via `/` slash command                 | Reusable task templates                         |
| Custom agents          | `*.agent.md`              | User picks in agent selector, or auto-delegated | Focused roles with restricted tools             |
| Skills                 | `SKILL.md` in subfolder   | On-demand when task matches description         | Multi-step workflows with bundled assets        |

**Key rules:**

- `copilot-instructions.md` should be **short** (~40 lines). It loads into every request's context window.
  Link to `docs/*.md` files rather than duplicating content.
- File instructions use `applyTo` globs to auto-attach when relevant files are edited.
- The `description` field is the **discovery surface** — without good keywords, the agent won't find the file.
- Prompts replace the "start sessions with context" manual step — `/implement-feature` loads the right docs automatically.

**Bootstrap order (chicken-and-egg):**
The `copilot-instructions.md` and `write-spec.prompt.md` should be created **first**, before
writing any design docs. This way, AI assistance for drafting `docs/01-project-vision.md`
and feature specs already benefits from project context. The remaining file instructions,
agents, and skills are added later alongside the code they govern (Stage 4).

## 4.2 Multiple AI tools (opencode + Qwen via PLGrid llmlab)

The default driver for implementation sessions is **GitHub Copilot** (per
§4.1). However, Spike 1 and Spike 3 were already implemented successfully
with **opencode + Qwen3.5-397B**, so the project supports a parallel
multi-tool workflow. This section documents how to run an implementation
stage with opencode + Qwen against the PLGrid **llmlab** OpenAI-compatible
endpoint, and how to fall back to Copilot on `master` if the experiment
does not converge.

### When to consider Qwen / opencode

A stage or feature is a good Qwen candidate when it is:

- **Self-contained** — minimal cross-file context (e.g., the WASM wrapper
  in Stage 3, a single feature page in Stage 6).
- **Well-specified** — has a Final spec or ADR with explicit acceptance
  criteria (the AI's job is execution, not design).
- **Independently testable** — `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build`
  (or, for Stage 3, `node verify.mjs`) gives an unambiguous pass/fail.

Tightly coupled, design-heavy, or cross-cutting work should stay on
Copilot for now.

### Local setup (one-time)

1. **opencode** installed locally. opencode reads its config from
   `opencode.json` at the repo root or `~/.config/opencode/config.json`.
   Per-repo config is preferred so Qwen has the same defaults for every
   contributor. ✅ Created 19 April 2026: [`opencode.json`](../opencode.json) —
   PLGrid provider (env-var credentials), `@sveltejs/opencode` plugin,
   Tailwind MCP, Playwright MCP. Fill in `PLGRID_LLMLAB_BASE_URL` env var
   before first use.
2. **AGENTS.md** at the repo root acting as the opencode context-loading
   counterpart of `.github/copilot-instructions.md`. Keep it tiny and
   delegate to existing docs (do not duplicate content). ✅ Created
   19 April 2026: [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) — points at copilot-instructions,
   docs index, vendor library docs, MCP setup, and Svelte 5 rules.
3. **PLGrid llmlab credentials** — exported as an environment variable
   (e.g. `PLGRID_LLMLAB_API_KEY`). Never commit the key. `.gitignore`
   covers `.env`, `.env.*`, `.opencode/`, and `*.key`.
4. **opencode provider config** ✅ Done — see `opencode.json` above.
   Model id: `Qwen/Qwen3.5-397B-A17B-FP8` (as used in Spike 1/3 logs;
   verify against PLGrid's current model list before first use).
5. **Egress note** — PLGrid llmlab is reachable from your laptop, but
   **not** from GitHub Actions runners or the Copilot cloud agent. Qwen
   sessions are therefore human-driven from a developer machine; CI runs
   the same lint/test/build matrix regardless of which AI authored the
   commit.

### Branching, attribution, and fall-back

- **Branch name**: `qwen/<stage-or-feature>` (e.g. `qwen/stage-3-wasm`,
  `qwen/feature-calculator`). The prefix flags the branch as an
  experiment.
- **PR title**: prefix with `[qwen]` so reviewers know to expect a
  different style.
- **Attribution**: every `CHANGELOG-AI.md` entry and every
  `docs/ai-logs/...` session log MUST record the model and tool, e.g.
  `(opencode + Qwen3.5-397B)` — already the convention for the Qwen
  spikes; now mandatory (see §9).
- **Fall-back rule**: time-box each Qwen attempt (suggested: one working
  day per stage, two for Stage 3). If the branch does not pass
  `pnpm lint && pnpm test && pnpm build` and the spec's Acceptance
  Criteria within the time-box, **do not merge**. File a closing log
  entry under `docs/ai-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-qwen-<stage>-attempt.md` with
  what worked, what failed, and any reusable artifacts; abandon the
  branch; resume the same stage on `master` with Copilot.
- **Merge gate** (when Qwen does succeed): same CI as Copilot work, plus
  a human or Copilot review pass. Squash-merge so the `master` history
  stays linear regardless of authorship.

### What you do **not** need

- No new MCP servers, Skills, or prompt files. opencode + Qwen reads the
  existing `docs/` tree directly — this is the spec-driven payoff.
- No spec rewrites. Specs are tool-agnostic.
- No Copilot-specific tools (`parallel_validation`, `report_progress`)
  on the Qwen side. Substitute manual `pnpm` commands and `git push`.

## 6. WASM API Contract (Target TypeScript Interface)

This is the most critical design artifact. All frontend code and tests
are written against this interface. The WASM implementation is swappable
(mocked in tests, real in production).

> **The full contract lives in [`docs/06-wasm-api-contract.md`](06-wasm-api-contract.md).**
> Below is a brief summary. Always refer to the full document for implementation.

### Key types

| Type                | Purpose                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LibdedxEntity`     | Base: `{ id, name }`                                                            |
| `ParticleEntity`    | Extends base with `massNumber`, `atomicMass`, `aliases`                         |
| `ProgramEntity`     | Extends base with `version`                                                     |
| `MaterialEntity`    | Extends base with `density`, `isGasByDefault`                                   |
| `CalculationResult` | `{ energies, stoppingPowers, csdaRanges }`                                      |
| `AdvancedOptions`   | `{ aggregateState, interpolation, mstarMode, densityOverride, iValueOverride }` |
| `CustomCompound`    | User-defined material with elemental composition                                |
| `LibdedxError`      | Typed error with C error code + message                                         |

### Key design decisions

- **Energy units:** MeV/nucl ≠ MeV/u. The C API uses MeV/nucl; conversion is JS-side.
- **Stateless by default:** Calls go through `dedx_wrappers.h`; stateful API only for custom compounds, inverse lookups, and advanced options.
- **Thin C wrappers:** Local `wasm/dedx_extra.{h,c}` expose internal libdedx data (nucleon number, atomic mass, density, gas state) without modifying the libdedx submodule.
- **ESTAR included:** Electrons via particle ID 1001.
- **MSTAR modes exposed:** 6 modes (a/b/c/d/g/h), default "b".
- **Aggregate state exposed:** 29 gaseous-default materials; override in advanced settings.

## 7. Feature Spec Template

Every feature spec in `docs/04-feature-specs/` should follow this format.
AI agents produce significantly better code when given specs in this structure.

```markdown
# Feature: <Name>

## User Story

As a <role>, I want to <action> so that <benefit>.

## Inputs

- (list all user inputs with types and constraints)

## Behavior

- (describe step-by-step what happens, including edge cases)

## Output

- (describe what the user sees / receives)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] (testable criterion 1)
- [ ] (testable criterion 2)
- [ ] ...
```

## 8. Implementation Stages

### Stage 0: AI Agent Bootstrap

- **Who:** You (human) + AI for drafting.
- **Produce:**
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — project context, Svelte 5 rules, build commands.
  - `.github/prompts/write-spec.prompt.md` — slash command for drafting feature specs.
  - `.github/prompts/implement-feature.prompt.md` — slash command for implementing from a spec.
- **Why first:** All subsequent stages use AI assistance. Having `copilot-instructions.md`
  ensures the agent already knows this is a Svelte 5 + TypeScript + WASM project, won't
  suggest Svelte 4 patterns, and can reference design docs. The `write-spec` prompt makes
  Stage 1 (writing feature specs) faster and more consistent.
- **Verify:** Start a new Copilot chat and confirm the agent mentions Svelte 5 / runes
  without being told. Test `/write-spec` produces output following the template from §7.

### Stage 1: Requirements & Specifications

- **Who:** You (human), AI assists with drafts (use `/write-spec` prompt).
- **Produce:** `docs/01-project-vision.md`, all `docs/04-feature-specs/*.md`, `docs/06-wasm-api-contract.md`, `docs/10-terminology.md`.
- **Validate:** You review all specs for physics correctness.
- **Terminology scope:** Two audiences — (1) _physics / end-user_: domain terms used in the UI, tooltips, and user documentation (stopping power, CSDA range, Bragg additivity, mean excitation energy, etc.); (2) _developer_: technical-stack terms used in code, commit messages, and internal docs (WASM, Emscripten, runes, dedx_config, entity, series, etc.).

### Stage 2: Technical Architecture

- **Who:** You + AI.
- **Produce:** `docs/02-tech-stack.md`, `docs/03-architecture.md`, ADRs in `docs/decisions/`.
- **Key:** Document _why_ SvelteKit, _why_ keep JSROOT, WASM module format (ES module).

### Stage 2.5: Prototyping Spikes (Risk Reduction)

- **Who:** AI implements autonomously (one spike per session).
- **Input:** [`docs/11-prototyping-spikes.md`](11-prototyping-spikes.md).
- **Produce:** Four throwaway prototypes in `prototypes/` that validate:
  1. JSROOT 7 rendering inside a Svelte 5 `$effect` (DOM ownership, cleanup, re-draw). ✅
  2. Emscripten `--preload-file` served by SvelteKit static adapter and sub-path hosting. ✅
  3. Module-level `$state` with `{ value: T }` wrapper reactive across components. ✅
  4. External data format: Zarr v3 + sharding vs Apache Parquet — file size, per-ion
     HTTP Range reads, and `zarrita` vs `hyparquet` JS bundle size.
- **Gate (Stage 3):** Spikes 1–3 must pass before Stage 3 begins. ✅ Gate open.
- **Gate (external-data feature):** Spike 4 must produce `VERDICT.md` before
  `docs/04-feature-specs/external-data.md` is implemented.
- **Verify:** Each spike produces a `VERDICT.md` with pass/fail per criterion.

### Stage 2.6: libdedx Data Source Investigation (pre-Stage 3 gate)

- **Who:** AI-assisted investigation.
- **Purpose:** Full static analysis of libdedx C headers to verify data availability,
  coverage, units, and bundle strategy before Stage 3 implementation begins.
- **Produce:**
  - `prototypes/libdedx-investigation/inspect_headers.py` — static analysis script (no compilation)
  - `prototypes/libdedx-investigation/data/headers_stats.json` — machine-readable full output
  - `prototypes/libdedx-investigation/REPORT.md` — markdown report with all findings
- **Phase 1 complete (15 April 2026).** Key findings:
  - **Data fully embedded** — `dedx_data_access.c` has zero `fopen()` calls; all
    stopping-power tables are compiled-in static arrays. The Spike 2 `.data` sidecar
    was never read at runtime. **Outcome A confirmed.**
  - **`--preload-file` unnecessary for runtime** — investigation confirmed the Stage 3
    WASM build target is `.mjs` + `.wasm` only; ADR 003 must stay in sync with this decision.
  - **ESTAR open** — `dedx_estar.h` not compiled by `dedx_embedded_data.c`; resolved in Phase 2.
  - **19 tabulated ions** (Z=1, 2, 3–18, electron); ~240-particle claim applies to parametric path.
  - **279 materials** (spec ~280 — CLOSE); 29 gas targets (exact match).
  - **Units confirmed** — density g/cm³, I-value eV, STP MeV·cm²/g, CSDA g/cm².
  - **412 KB raw float data** across unique tables; estimated Stage 3 WASM: ~650–860 KB.
- **Phase 2 complete:** WASM runtime verification resolved the ESTAR question, confirmed
  `dedx_fill_program_list()` / `dedx_fill_ion_list()` outputs, and spot-checked representative STP values.
- **Gate:** Investigation complete. Stage 3 may proceed on the verified `.mjs` + `.wasm`
  build path; remaining follow-up is to keep ADR 003/documentation aligned with the implemented build.

### Stage 3: WASM Build Pipeline Redesign ✅

- **Who:** AI implements.
- **Input:** `docs/06-wasm-api-contract.md`, `docs/decisions/003-wasm-build-pipeline.md`.
- **Output:** New build script, TypeScript wrapper in `src/lib/wasm/`, ES module `.mjs` + `.wasm`.
- **Test-driven principle:** For each Stage 3 increment, add or tighten
  verification assertions first (RED). Until `wasm/verify.mjs` is relocated in
  Stage 3, start from
  `prototypes/libdedx-investigation/wasm-runtime/verify.mjs` (see
  `docs/07-testing-strategy.md` §5), then implement wrapper/build changes until
  checks pass (GREEN), then refactor without changing behavior and re-run the
  same verification checks after refactor.
- **CI (first PR gate):** Delete `.github/workflows/test_and_deploy.yml` (legacy CRA);
  add `.github/workflows/ci.yml` triggering on every push/PR to `master` — runs
  the verification script from its current location first, then `node wasm/verify.mjs`
  after relocation.
- **Verify:** The verification script passes from
  `prototypes/libdedx-investigation/wasm-runtime/verify.mjs` during transition
  and, after relocation, from `wasm/verify.mjs`; TypeScript wrapper returns
  valid program/particle/material lists.
- **Status:** GREEN phase complete (21 April 2026). All 67 contract checks pass.
  See `docs/progress/stage-3.md`.

> **WASM output location (resolved):** `wasm/build.sh` now outputs to
> `static/wasm/libdedx.{mjs,wasm}` with `ENVIRONMENT=web,node`. The `node` component
> preserves `verify.mjs` Node.js compatibility without a separate build. CI uploads
> `static/wasm/` as an artifact from the `wasm-verify` job; the `e2e-tests` job
> downloads it before `pnpm build`. Resolved on branch `fix/wasm-web-ci`.

### Stage 3.7: Legacy Code Removal ✅ (21 April 2026)

- **Rationale:** Moved forward from Stage 10. The old React codebase conflicts with
  Stage 3 work (wrong `src/` structure, broken `package.json` scripts, CRA artefacts
  in `public/`). The new SvelteKit project cannot coexist with these files.
- **Removed:**
  - `src/` — entire legacy React codebase (App.js, Backend/, Components/, Styles/,
    `__test__/`, index.js, reportWebVitals.js, setupTests.js, logo.svg)
  - `public/index.html`, `public/logo192.png`, `public/logo512.png`,
    `public/manifest.json`, `public/robots.txt` — CRA public artefacts
  - `build_wasm.sh` — superseded by `wasm/build.sh`
- **Kept:**
  - `public/favicon.ico` — project favicon (to be copied to SvelteKit `static/`)
  - `public/webdEdx_logo.svg` — project logo (to be copied to SvelteKit `static/`)
- **Note:** `package.json` has already been reduced to the temporary WASM-only
  scripts needed before scaffolding; Stage 4 replaces it with the SvelteKit project
  manifest.
- **Legacy code last commit:** `0330233` (`docs: add AI session logging system`).

### Stage 3.8: Early development deploy ✅ (21 April 2026)

- **Rationale:** Establish the `master → APTG/web_dev` deployment pipeline so
  it is exercised and confirmed working well before the full app is complete.
  Makes the dev site immediately visible to collaborators.
- **Deliverables:**
  - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` — triggers on push to `master`; builds the
    WASM + SvelteKit app and deploys to `APTG/web_dev` via
    `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`.
  - `docs/08-deployment.md §5.1` — documents early deploy phase, one-time
    repo setup, and Stage 9 migration path.
- **One-time repo setup (human step):** Create a fine-grained PAT with
  `Contents: Read and write` on `APTG/web_dev`, store as
  `WEB_DEV_DEPLOY_TOKEN` secret; enable GitHub Pages on `APTG/web_dev`
  (source: `gh-pages` branch); create `dev` environment in `dedx_web` repo
  settings. See [`docs/08-deployment.md §5.1`](08-deployment.md) for the
  full checklist.
- **Stage 9 migration:** add `v*` tag trigger and a production deploy job to
  `deploy.yml` that builds and pushes `build/` to `APTG/web`.

### Stage 4: Project Scaffolding + Full AI Config

- **Who:** AI implements.
- **Input:** `docs/02-tech-stack.md`, `docs/03-architecture.md`.
- **Output:** SvelteKit project with Tailwind, two routes, Vitest, Playwright, static adapter,
  ESLint + Prettier configured.
- **Also produce** (now that the project structure exists):
  - `.github/instructions/svelte.instructions.md` — Svelte 5 component patterns.
  - `.github/instructions/wasm.instructions.md` — WASM wrapper rules.
  - `.github/instructions/testing.instructions.md` — test conventions.
  - `.github/agents/researcher.agent.md` — read-only codebase explorer.
  - `.github/skills/wasm-build/SKILL.md` — WASM build pipeline procedure.
- **Expand CI:** add `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check` (svelte-check + tsc),
  `pnpm build` to `ci.yml` — every PR now gets a full type-check and build gate.
- **Verify:** App builds, routes work, `eslint . && prettier --check .` pass, deploys to GitHub Pages (empty pages).

### Stage 5: Core Shared Components ✅ (28 April 2026)

- **Who:** AI implements (one component per chat session).
- **Order:**
  1. ✅ Entity selection (cascading dropdowns) — Svelte stores + WASM ([PR #366](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/366), Apr 2026; cascading-fixes [PR #371](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/371))
  2. ✅ Energy input component — textarea with per-line validation, debounce ([PR #368](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/368), Apr 2026)
  3. ✅ Unit selector — radio/segmented control ([PR #370](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/370), Apr 2026)
  4. ✅ Result table — unified input/result table ([PR #374](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/374), Apr 2026; follow-up fixes [PR #376](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/376), [PR #377](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/377), [PR #378](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/378), [PR #379](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/379))
  5. ✅ JSROOT plot wrapper — Svelte component managing JSROOT lifecycle ([PR #394](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/394), Apr 2026)
- **Expand CI:** add `pnpm test` (Vitest) to `ci.yml` — first unit tests are written
  in this stage; every PR's test suite must pass before merge.
- **Status:** Complete. See [`docs/progress/stage-5.md`](progress/stage-5.md) for the consolidated stage summary, [`docs/progress/stage-5-entity-selection.md`](progress/stage-5-entity-selection.md), [`docs/progress/stage-5.4-result-table.md`](progress/stage-5.4-result-table.md), [`docs/progress/stage-5-audit-2026-04-26.md`](progress/stage-5-audit-2026-04-26.md), and the closing [UX review](ux-reviews/2026-04-28-stage5-completion-and-stage6-readiness.md).

### Stage 6: Feature Pages ✅ Complete (May 2026)

- **Who:** AI implements per feature spec (one sub-stage per session).
- **Input:** Individual spec files in `docs/04-feature-specs/`.
- **Status:** All 13 sub-stages complete. Calculator core, live calc, multi-program comparison, Plot page, shareable URLs, basic/advanced export, Build Info badge, Advanced Options, Inverse Lookups, Custom Compounds, advanced export additions, multi-program polish, and formal URL parser are all shipped.

Most styling (log-log defaults, axis labels with units, line width 2, color palette, grid, disabled scroll-zoom) was implemented in earlier stages. Font size: visual inspection found JSROOT defaults more readable than a forced 0.04 NDC override — no explicit font-size set. No JSROOT canvas legend — series list below canvas serves as legend per `plot.md`. [log](progress/stage-7.2.md)         |

### Stage 8: Open Beta & User Feedback ⏳ Active

- **Who:** You (human) collects feedback; AI implements fixes per issue.
- **When:** Active after Stage 7 completion; `APTG/web_dev` is already live on every `master` push.
- **Goal:** Catch visual/layout bugs and UX annoyances before the production release.
  During this window both apps are live for side-by-side comparison:
  - `aptg.github.io/web` — v1.1.0 (old React app, still works as reference)
  - `aptg.github.io/web_dev` — v2.x (new SvelteKit app, receiving feedback)
    Once Stage 9 tags `v2.0.0`, `APTG/web` gets overwritten and the comparison
    window closes — so this stage must happen first.
- **Process:**
  1. Share the `web_dev` URL with users and invite feedback.
  2. File issues on GitHub with a `beta-feedback` label; tag critical ones `must-fix`.
  3. Fix issues in `master` — each push auto-deploys to `web_dev`.
  4. Repeat until all `must-fix` issues are resolved and the team is satisfied.
- **Gate (Stage 9):** No open `beta-feedback` issues tagged `must-fix`; team sign-off.
- **Verify:** `web_dev` reflects all fixes; acceptance from at least one external user.

Adds a recipe bar (`particle → material → program` + reset), inline Z=… in particle labels, side-by-side Elements / Compounds / Custom columns in the Material tab with density rendered as `(ρ=… g/cm³)` next to the name, an `+ Add compound` button surfacing the modal Custom Compound editor, a `DATA` program tag in place of the keyboard-evocative `TAB` badge, auto-collapse on Calculator when the selection is complete, and mobile-stacked tab labels. Dropped the `?v8=1` feature flag and the parallel `picker-mode` switch; the picker reads the global `isAdvancedMode` for Custom column + `⊞ explore compat` visibility. Renamed all components/tests/test IDs to `entity-selection/` and `picker-*` so the source no longer carries the `v8` codename. |
| [#511](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/511) | Entity-selector chrome + state rework                    | ✅     | Removed `recipe-bar.svelte` and the `picker-recipe-*` testids; added `activeTarget`, `expanded`, `across`, `multiSelected` to `EntitySelectionState` with `setActiveTarget` / `setExpanded` / `setAcross` / `toggleMulti` setters; introduced `advanced-toolbar.svelte` (Compare-across dropdown — Programs enabled, Materials/Particles disabled; Load-external + Explore-compat disabled placeholders; `↺` reset); tabs render a coral active-target underline and a red-dashed/`!`-badge empty-tab styling (`picker-tab-{id}-empty` testid); Material tab gains coral `+ New custom material` pill in Advanced; `multi-list.svelte` drafted then deleted after review (invalid HTML, no consumers); `showAdvancedToolbar` prop hides toolbar on Plot.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [#516](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/516) | Persistent picker-level search row                       | ✅     | Lifted per-tab `<SearchInput>` out of `particle-tab.svelte` / `material-tab.svelte` / `program-tab.svelte` into a single `<EntitySelection>`-owned search row (`data-testid="picker-search-row"`) between the tab bar and the panel. Added chevron toggle (`▼` / `▲`, `data-testid="picker-toggle"`) on the right edge that expands/collapses the panel via `selectionState.setExpanded`. Placeholder switches with `activeTarget`; `data-testid` follows `picker-{activeTab}-search` so existing tests keep working. Particle ↑/↓/↵ keyboard nav preserved via `$bindable` handler slots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Each source row is now individually collapsible (`<details>`). Per-source × Remove button calls `externalDataService.evict(label)` then the parent-supplied `onRemove` callback. Both calculator and plot pages filter the evicted label from `loadedExternalSources`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [#521](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/521) | Load-external modal: URL validator + drag-drop + recents | ✅     | New `load-external-modal.svelte` (bits-ui `Dialog`): URL tab with `https?://…\.webdedx` regex validation + auto-label from URL stem + `webdedx.externalRecents.v1` localStorage recents (5 entries, click-to-fill); Local directory tab with File System Access API drop zone (Chrome/Edge 86+, graceful degradation). New `FileSystemDirectoryHandleStore` (zarrita-compatible). Added `ExternalDataService.loadFromUrl()` / `loadFromDirectory()`; `loadStoreMetadataFromStore` + optional `storeOverride` on slice loaders; non-http sources filtered from shareable URL. `onLoadExternal` prop wired through `entity-selection.svelte` → `AdvancedToolbar` — enables the formerly-disabled button. Runtime source-add rebuilds `ExternalCompatibilityContext` in `calculator/+page.svelte`.                                                                                                                                    |

| [#522](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/522) | Drag handle reorder in multi-program-picker | ✅ | Added ⋮⋮ drag handle on each selected non-default program row in `multi-program-picker.svelte`. Mouse reorder via HTML5 DnD API; touch reorder via `touchstart`/`touchmove`/`touchend` + `document.elementFromPoint`; `Alt+ArrowUp`/`Alt+ArrowDown` keyboard reorder when handle has focus (blocked at position 1 to preserve default-first invariant). Always-present `aria-live="polite"` region announces "Moved X to position N of M" after each reorder. 14 new unit tests covering handle visibility, keyboard reorder edge cases, and announcement content. |
| [#523](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/523) | Compare-across Materials / Particles end-to-end | ✅ | Enabled the previously-disabled Materials and Particles options in the `picker-compare-across` dropdown (`advanced-toolbar.svelte`). Introduced `MultiEntityState` (`src/lib/state/multi-entity.svelte.ts`) — a lightweight analog to `MultiProgramState` that holds `comparisonResults` keyed by entity ID and a display-name resolver. Added multi-select rendering to `particle-tab.svelte` and `material-tab.svelte`: dismissible pills for selected entities, ✓ indicators per row, anchor-entity "(anchor)" label, `aria-multiselectable` on list. Wired debounced WASM calculation effects in `calculator/+page.svelte` that iterate over `entityState.multiSelected[dim]` and populate `MultiEntityState.comparisonResults`. `ResultTable` gains a new `{:else if isMultiEntity}` branch rendering grouped two-row headers (STP + CSDA groups, per-entity sub-headers with ◆ anchor marker) and per-entity result cells. `MultiProgramPicker` now renders only when `across === "program"`. |
| [#524](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/524) | Retire SelectedPill + MultiProgramPicker; add collapseToSingle | ✅ | Deleted `selected-pill.svelte` (inlining its markup into particle-tab, material-tab, and program-tab) and `multi-program-picker.svelte` with its 256-line test suite (superseded by program-tab multi-select). Added multi-select UI to program-tab: anchor chip + dismissible comparison chips, ✓ indicators per row, disabled anchor row; gated on `showAdvancedToolbar && across === "program"` to avoid false activation from the `"program"` default. Added `collapseToSingle()` to `EntitySelectionState` — truncates all three multi-arrays to their anchor (index 0) when the user switches back to basic mode. Added `setMultiProgram()` for seeding entity state from a freshly created `MultiProgramState` without triggering `setAcross` side effects. Wired `entityState.multiSelected.program` ↔ `multiProgState` in `calculator/+page.svelte` via two `$effect`s: one seeds on creation (using `untrack()`), one syncs add/remove on every toggle. 7 new unit tests for `collapseToSingle` covering all three dimensions independently. |
| [#525](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/525) | Mobile nav two-row layout + Material-tab card polish | ✅ | At `< sm` (640 px) the nav bar splits into two rows: Row 1 shows the favicon icon only (text `hidden sm:inline`) + Calculator / Plot / Docs links; Row 2 shows Basic/Advanced toggle + Share URL separated by a thin `border-t`. Each Material-tab column (Elements / Compounds / Custom) gains `overscroll-y-contain` to stop page-scroll bleed, a bottom fade-shadow gradient as a scrollability hint, and a `⤢` expand button (hidden on `sm+`) that opens the full column as a fixed full-screen sheet closed by Escape or ✕. Svelte 5 `{#snippet}` blocks share list-item rendering between the inline card and the full-screen sheet without duplication. |
| [#529](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/529) | Mobile nav hierarchy follow-up (issue #528) | ✅ | Follow-up on issue #528: two-row header with prominent full-width Calculator/Plot/Docs tabs, active-tab emphasis (`aria-current="page"`), docs/changelog log corrections, and selector contract alignment (`data-testid="app-header"`) requested in review comments. |
| [#531](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/531) | Adaptive picker kit (issue #530 PR A) | ✅ | Adds adaptive picker buckets (`tiny`/`medium`/`large`), flat Z-sorted particle lists, material sub-tab pills with persistence + scroll memory, tiny-bucket inline program list, and a full-screen mobile search sheet with grouped material results. Review follow-ups: pair sheet `pushState` with cleanup `history.back()` on UI-close, remove duplicated particle Z badge in sheet rows, remove unused material-subtab state API surface, make material sub-tab counts query-consistent, simplify always-on Custom group rendering, and route tiny-list auto-select through `selectionState.selectProgram(-1)`. |
| [#532](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/532) | Plot add-series flow + keyboard shortcuts (issue #530 PR B) | ✅ | Fixes JSROOT `ObjectPainter.mjs` empty-draw crash on first client-side navigation (guard prevents draw with empty multigraph; "Loading plot engine…" placeholder stays until proton+water preview arrives). Resolves Part A deferred choices: ★ prefix for named particles (proton/alpha) in inline list and picker sheet; 200 ms slide-up fly transition for mobile sheet with `prefers-reduced-motion` fallback. Adds `/` keyboard shortcut to focus search (expands panel if collapsed); adds keyboard shortcuts table to the user guide. Adds `updateSeries()` to `PlotState`. Introduces `SeriesStrip` component with live-edit mode — clicking a committed series row copies its entities to the picker for live mutation, with `ring-2` highlight and Done button. Re-lays out plot page: removes old mobile disclosure pattern, uses `collapsible` picker + `SeriesStrip`. Adds `handleAddOrMulti` + `handleAddMultiSeries` for Advanced mode multi-create across particle/material/program dimensions. New tests: `search-input-keyboard.spec.ts` (7 unit), `keyboard-nav.spec.ts` (5 E2E), `plot-add-series.spec.ts` (5 E2E). |
| [#535](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/535) | Fix Firefox JSROOT module-race error + source map paths | ✅ | Silences the Firefox-specific `TypeError: can't access property "jsroot" of undefined` by wrapping the JSROOT draw call in `drawWithRetry` with exponential backoff (5 attempts: 0/100/200/400/800 ms). Fixes incorrect source map `sourceRoot` paths emitted by Rollup by adding a `sourcemapPathTransform` in `vite.config.ts`. |
| [#537](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/537) | JSROOT drawWithRetry exponential backoff (issue #536) | ✅ | Adds `drawWithRetry` helper with 5 attempts and exponential backoff to make plotting resilient to transient JSROOT module initialisation races; removes the direct `drawPlot` call in favour of the retry wrapper. |
| [#539](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/539) | Fix plotting permanently via jsroot UMD bundle (issue #538) | 🚧 | Root cause of issue #538: jsroot 7.11.0 added `import('@resvg/resvg-js')` in `BasePainter.mjs`; the project's Vite alias pointing that to a local shim altered Rollup's chunk evaluation order, exposing the pre-existing circular dependency between `core.mjs` and `ObjectPainter.mjs`. `drawWithRetry` couldn't fix this because the broken module state is permanent per page load. Fix: Vite plugin `copy-jsroot-bundle` copies `node_modules/jsroot/build/jsroot.min.js` → `static/jsroot.min.js` at build start; component loads it via a `<script>` tag (`getJsroot()`) instead of `import("jsroot")`. jsroot's own UMD bundle uses the correct evaluation order. `drawWithRetry` removed. |
| [#540](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/540) | Compact sticky summary bar + selection indicator polish (issue #533) | ✅ | Replaced the ambiguous grey selected-badge and multi-select pills with a shared `picker-summary-bar.svelte` (orange count badge, truncated labels, Clear button, All/Sel-only toggle). Selected list rows now use `ring-1 ring-inset ring-orange-400` + `✓` orange checkmark instead of the old filled `bg-primary/15`. Fixed `isMultiMode` gating in particle-tab and material-tab to require `isAdvancedMode.value &&` so that ○ circles and anchor labels no longer ghost after switching back to basic mode. Removed `(anchor)` label from all picker list rows across particle, material, program, grouped-result-list, program-inline-list, and picker-sheet. |
| [#565](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/565) | URL schema v2 design doc + ADR + cross-spec sync (issue #554) | 🚧 | Documentation-only PR covering the URL contract for the calculator-table redesign (#552 / #526). Bumped `urlv` 1 → 2 and adopted: `eunit=` → `uanchor=MeV\|MeV/nucl\|MeV/u` (always emitted, case-sensitive); `qfocus=stp\|csda\|both` → `qshow=stp\|range` (2-state, default omitted); `imode=csda\|stp` → `calc=forward\|range\|inverse-stp` (`forward` default omitted); explicit `mode=basic\|advanced`; `hidden_programs=` removed; `ivalues=` → `lookups=` (avoids Bethe-Bloch I-value collision); new params `runit=nm\|um\|mm\|cm\|dm\|m\|km`, `sunit=`, `across=`, `istpbranch=hi\|lo\|both`, `tip_seen=`. Advanced mode remains explicit as `mode=advanced`; plural comparison lists (`particles=`, `materials=`, `programs=`) are gated by `across=`. Entity-ID params (`particle=`, `material=`, `program=`) kept unchanged from v1 (link-rot cost > readability gain — ADR 006 §3). Energy per-row `:unit` suffix set expanded to the full 5×3 cross product (`eV` … `TeV` × none/`/nucl`/`/u` = 15 tokens). Added v1→v2 migration banner + future-version blocking modal spec. Merged the previously separate `url-schema.md` into `shareable-urls.md` v7 / `shareable-urls-formal.md` v7. Added a "v1 URL examples — see shareable-urls.md for v2" deprecation banner to `entity-selection.md`, `multi-program.md`, `advanced-options.md`, `inverse-lookups.md`, `custom-compounds.md`, `calculator.md`, `stage-6-13-url-parser.md`. ADR `docs/decisions/006-url-schema-v2.md`. Blocks behavioural rollout in #555–#561. |
| [#568](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/pull/568) | Inline-unit UX + URL v2 follow-ups | 🚧 | Follow-up fixes for inline-unit parsing and URL schema v2 rollout: align version negotiation with `urlv=2`, keep local/session storage access best-effort in the Basic results hint, clear hint timeout on unmount, set Basic energy input keyboard mode to text for inline unit suffix entry, and update Playwright expectations for `lookups=` plus explicit Basic-mode `+ Add row` behavior. |

### Stage 9: CI/CD — Deploy job

- `ci.yml` already has lint, type-check, Vitest, Playwright, and build from Stages 3–7.
- This stage adds the **deploy job**: push `build/` to `APTG/web_dev` on `master`,
  to `APTG/web` on `v*` tag. See [`docs/08-deployment.md §5`](08-deployment.md)
  for the full workflow YAML.
- **First production release:** tag `v2.0.0` → deploys to `APTG/web`, replacing v1.1.0.

### Stage 10: Legacy Code Removal ✅ (completed early as Stage 3.7)

- Legacy React source, CRA public artefacts, and `build_wasm.sh` were removed on
  21 April 2026 as Stage 3.7, ahead of the originally planned post-deployment window.
  See §8 Stage 3.7 for the complete file list and rationale.
- No separate Stage 10 cleanup remains in `package.json`; Stage 4 replaces it wholesale
  when the SvelteKit app is scaffolded.
- The old code is preserved in git history; the last commit containing it is referenced in §11.

## 9. Best Practices for AI Agent Sessions

| Practice                                                   | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` first**         | Every AI session benefits from project context from the start.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **One feature per chat session**                           | Agents lose context in long threads. Start fresh per feature.                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Use `/implement-feature` and `/write-spec` prompts**     | Consistent context loading without manual re-explanation.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Always reference spec files**                            | Don't re-explain — say "implement per docs/04-feature-specs/calculator.md".                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Start sessions with context**                            | "Read docs/03-architecture.md and docs/06-wasm-api-contract.md, then implement X."                                                                                                                                           |
| **Commit after each working increment**                    | Rollback points if AI produces broken code.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Enforce Svelte 5 in instructions**                       | AI training data has more Svelte 4 than 5. Explicit rules prevent `export let`, `$:`, `createEventDispatcher`.                                                                                                               |
| **Test WASM with real module early**                       | Mocks hide memory management bugs.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Log decisions in `docs/decisions/`**                     | Future sessions need this context.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Review AI-generated tests**                              | AI writes tests that pass by construction — check they assert real behavior.                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Use RED → GREEN → REFACTOR in migration stages**         | Keeps implementation tied to executable acceptance criteria and reduces regressions during rewrites.                                                                                                                         |
| **Be specific about JSROOT styling**                       | "Log-log axes, 14pt labels, legend top-right, line width 2" — not "make it pretty."                                                                                                                                          |
| **Log progress in `docs/progress/`**                       | So the next session knows what's done and what's next.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Run `eslint . && prettier --check .` before committing** | Catch formatting/lint issues AI may introduce.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Log every AI session**                                   | Append to `CHANGELOG-AI.md` + create `docs/ai-logs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. See `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for format.                                                                                                  |
| **Record model + tool in every log entry**                 | Both `CHANGELOG-AI.md` entries and session logs must include `(<model> via <tool>)` — e.g. `(Claude Sonnet 4.6)` for Copilot, `(opencode + Qwen3.5-397B)` for opencode/PLGrid. Required for multi-tool workflows (see §4.2). |

## 10. How to Resume This Work

When starting a new LLM session on any machine:

1. Open the working branch (check `git branch` or `CHANGELOG-AI.md` for the latest).
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` loads automatically — no manual context needed.
3. Check `docs/progress/` to see which stage was last completed.
4. Check `CHANGELOG-AI.md` for recent AI session history.
5. Use `/implement-feature` prompt pointing to the relevant spec, or tell the agent:
   _"Read `docs/00-redesign-plan.md` for full project context."_
6. After implementing, update `docs/progress/` and commit.

## 11. Existing Codebase Reference

The current (old) code has useful reference material despite being broken.
The last commit on `master` containing this code should be tagged or noted
before Stage 10 (legacy removal). You can find it with `git log master --oneline -1`.
