# Stage 3.7: Legacy Code Removal + Plan Update

**Date:** 2026-04-21
**Stage:** 3.7 (Legacy Cleanup — moved forward from Stage 9)
**Model:** (Claude Sonnet 4.6 via Claude Code)

---

## Summary

Removed the old React/CRA source base that was conflicting with Stage 3
implementation work. Updated the redesign plan to reflect the early removal
and documented the two WASM transition items that need to be addressed in Stage 4.

---

## WASM Cross-Check Findings

Cross-checked the current `wasm/` directory against ADR 003 (`docs/decisions/003-wasm-build-pipeline.md`).

| Check                            | Finding                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `wasm/dedx_extra.{h,c}` location | ✅ Correct — `wasm/` per ADR 003                     |
| `wasm/verify.mjs` location       | ✅ Correct — `wasm/` per plan §8 Stage 3             |
| `wasm/build.sh` output path      | ⚠️ `wasm/output/` — ADR 003 target is `static/wasm/` |
| `ENVIRONMENT` flag               | ⚠️ `node` — ADR 003 specifies `web` for production   |
| `.data` sidecar                  | ✅ Not produced — correct, no `--preload-file`       |
| `wasm/output/` content           | Not present (build not run since merge) — expected   |

### Why the discrepancies are intentional (for now)

**Output location (`wasm/output/` vs `static/wasm/`):** The `static/` directory
does not exist yet — SvelteKit is scaffolded in Stage 4. Outputting to
`wasm/output/` is the correct interim behaviour so `verify.mjs` can run without
SvelteKit present. Stage 4 must update `build.sh` to output to `static/wasm/`.

**`ENVIRONMENT=node`:** `verify.mjs` loads `libdedx.mjs` in Node.js. A build with
`ENVIRONMENT=web` strips Node.js I/O shims and will fail under Node. The current
`node` flag is the only way to keep CI verification working before the SvelteKit
app exists. Stage 4 must introduce a production build target with `ENVIRONMENT=web`.

Both items are documented in `docs/progress/stage-3.md` and in `docs/00-redesign-plan.md`
§8 (Stage 3 transition note).
