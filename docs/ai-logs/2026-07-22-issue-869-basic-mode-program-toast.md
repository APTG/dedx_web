# 2026-07-22 — Basic-mode `program=` toast (#869)

## Session Narrative

### Prompt 1: Investigate an aidedx→calculator hand-off bug

The user reported that aidedx (a sister chat-assistant project) answers "The
CSDA range of 220.5 keV boron ion in silicon is 1.044 µm (MSTAR)." and then
links to `/calculator?...&particle=5&material=14&program=6&energies=220.5:keV&eunit=MeV`,
which shows "1 of 1 values excluded (1 out of range)" instead of reproducing
the MSTAR answer.

**AI response**: Delegated the investigation to an Explore agent. Root cause
was three-layered:

1. `program=6` is ICRU 73 in libdedx's canonical enum (`libdedx/include/dedx.h`);
   MSTAR is `program=4`. aidedx's link used the wrong ID for what it claimed.
2. The link has no `mode=advanced`, so it's a Basic-mode link. dedx_web's
   Basic mode always resets to Auto-select on load (issue #816,
   `calculator-page-orchestrator.svelte.ts`'s `setupModeFallbacks`) —
   **any** explicit `program=` is silently discarded, valid or not.
3. Even ignoring (1) and (2), 220.5 keV Boron-11 ≈ 0.020 MeV/nucleon sits just
   under ICRU 73's 0.025 MeV/nucleon floor for ions heavier than He — the
   auto-selected program genuinely can't serve that energy, while MSTAR
   (floor 0.001 MeV/nucleon) can.

The `energies=220.5:keV` + `eunit=MeV` combination was checked and ruled out
— the per-row `:keV` suffix correctly takes precedence over the master
`eunit`, and unit conversion to MeV/nucleon was verified correct.

Filed two issues: [APTG/aidedx#116](https://github.com/APTG/aidedx/issues/116)
(wrong program ID + missing `mode=advanced`) and
[APTG/dedx_web#869](https://github.com/APTG/dedx_web/issues/869) (the "trap"
— dedx_web gives no feedback when Basic mode silently drops a URL's
`program=`, which is what let aidedx's bug go unnoticed).

### Prompt 2: Work issue #869

**AI response**: Implemented the toast fix described in #869's "suggested
improvement" (option 1: a toast mirroring the already-spec'd-but-unimplemented
"Program not available; using auto-select." text from
`shareable-urls.md` §8.1, adapted to the Basic-mode-specific wording since the
program here isn't "unavailable" — it's simply not selectable outside
Advanced mode).

## Tasks

### Toast when a Basic-mode URL's `program=` is discarded

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: bug fix, not a redesign-plan stage
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/lib/components/plot-toast.svelte` → renamed to
    `src/lib/components/notice-toast.svelte` (generalized: added an optional
    `testId` prop, default `"notice-toast"`, so the same component now backs
    both the Plot page's Add-Series confirmation and the Calculator page's
    new program notice, instead of duplicating the toast's timer/live-region
    logic a second time).
  - `src/tests/components/plot-toast.test.ts` → renamed to
    `notice-toast.test.ts`, updated to the new import/testid, plus one new
    test for the `testId` override.
  - `src/routes/plot/+page.svelte` — import/usage updated to `NoticeToast`
    with `testId="plot-toast"` (no behavior change; existing e2e test
    `tests/e2e/plot-add-series.spec.ts` still queries `data-testid="plot-toast"`).
  - `src/lib/state/calculator-page-orchestrator.svelte.ts` — added
    `programFeedback` state + `announceProgramFeedback()` (same
    `{ text, token }` shape as the plot orchestrator's `seriesFeedback`).
    Wired into `setupUrlHydration()`'s existing
    `if (urlState.programId !== null) appInit.entityState.selectProgram(...)`
    branch: when `!isAdvancedMode.value`, fires
    "Basic mode ignores the link's program; using auto-select." This runs
    once per page load (the surrounding effect is gated on `!this.calcState`).
  - `src/routes/calculator/+page.svelte` — mounts `<NoticeToast>` bound to
    `orchestrator.programFeedback`, placed outside the loading/`{:else if}`
    block so it can render regardless of load state.
  - `src/tests/contracts/page-init.contract.test.ts` — added two
    string-presence contract checks (matching this file's existing style)
    asserting the orchestrator calls `announceProgramFeedback` in the
    `urlState.programId !== null` branch, and that the Calculator page mounts
    `NoticeToast` bound to `orchestrator.programFeedback`.
  - `docs/04-feature-specs/entity-selection.md` — added a note to the #816
    footnote cross-referencing #869 and the new toast text.
  - `docs/04-feature-specs/shareable-urls.md` §8.1 — added a callout
    distinguishing this Basic-mode case (any `program=`, valid or not, always
    discarded) from the pre-existing "incompatible program ID" case (that
    spec's own "Program not available; using auto-select." toast is still
    unimplemented — not addressed in this session, out of scope for #869).
- **Decision**: Did not build a full orchestrator-mounting test harness —
  none exists in this codebase yet (`CalculatorPageOrchestrator` has zero
  existing unit tests; it depends on `$app/state`'s `page.url`, `appInit`,
  and the WASM loader singleton, none of which have a mocking precedent).
  Given the disproportionate setup cost for one behavior, matched existing
  project convention instead: `page-init.contract.test.ts`'s string-presence
  contract-test style (already used for other orchestrator/page wiring
  invariants like `initAdvancedModeFromUrl`), plus a real component test for
  the toast's rendering behavior itself (the part that's actually cheap to
  test in isolation).
  - **Decision**: Chose to generalize/rename `plot-toast.svelte` rather than
  duplicate its timer/dismiss/live-region logic for a second consumer — it
  was already shaped generically (`{ text, token }` signal), just named after
  its first and only caller.
- **Issue**: The broader "Program not available; using auto-select." toast
  for genuinely-invalid program IDs against the compatibility matrix (spec'd
  in `shareable-urls.md` §8.1, referenced in its own worked example) remains
  unimplemented — flagged in the doc, not fixed here, since #869 is
  specifically about the Basic-mode-always-discards-program case.

Full Vitest (1963) + ESLint + `format:check` clean; `svelte-check` 0
errors/0 warnings (pre-existing vendor/prototype config noise unrelated to
this change). Verified end-to-end with Playwright against a real production
build (local `static/wasm/` was already present): a new
`tests/e2e/calculator-basic-mode-program-toast.spec.ts` reproduces the exact
reported URL (`?urlv=3&particle=5&material=14&program=6&energies=220.5:keV&eunit=MeV`)
and asserts the toast appears, plus two negative cases (no `program=` param;
`mode=advanced` present) confirming it does *not* fire when it shouldn't — all
3 pass, as does the pre-existing `plot-add-series.spec.ts` (confirms the
`plot-toast.svelte` → `notice-toast.svelte` rename didn't regress the Plot
page's toast). The user declined to install the Claude in Chrome extension for
manual browser verification this session; added a note to `CLAUDE.md` recording
that preference (use Playwright instead) for future sessions.
