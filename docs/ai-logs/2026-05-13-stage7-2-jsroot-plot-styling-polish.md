# 2026-05-13 — Stage 7.2 JSROOT Plot Styling Polish

## Session Narrative

### Prompt 1: Analyse task 7.2 from the redesign plan — is there anything left to do or can we mark it as complete?

**AI response**: Launched two parallel Explore agents — one to read the redesign plan and `plot.md` spec, one to audit the live JSROOT implementation. Then read `jsroot-plot.svelte`, `plot-utils.ts`, the JSROOT Integration section of `plot.md`, and the progress files directly.

Findings:

The redesign plan lists task 7.2 as ⏳ "not started," but the audit revealed that the bulk of the "physics-grade defaults" had been implemented in earlier stages:

| Requirement | Status found |
|---|---|
| Log-log axes as default (`xLog: true`, `yLog: true`) | ✅ Done (earlier stages) |
| Axis labels with units | ✅ Done — "Energy [MeV/nucl]", "Stopping Power [{unit}]" |
| Line width 2 committed / width 1 preview | ✅ Done |
| Color palette (9 colors, exact hex values) | ✅ Done |
| Grid + tick draw options (`gridx;gridy;tickx;ticky`) | ✅ Done |
| Wheel zoom disabled | ✅ Done — `JSROOT.settings.ZoomWheel = false` |
| Touch zoom disabled on mobile/tablet | ✅ Done |
| No JSROOT canvas legend — series list as legend | ✅ Done |
| **14 pt fonts** | ❌ Missing — no `fLabelSize`/`fTitleSize` set anywhere |

Additionally, the redesign plan task note contained a contradiction: it said "legend top-right," but `plot.md`'s acceptance criteria explicitly state "No JSROOT-rendered legend on the canvas (the series list below the canvas serves as the legend)." The implementation correctly follows the spec (no canvas legend). The redesign plan note was stale.

Plan produced:
1. Add `fLabelSize = fTitleSize = 0.04` to `buildMultigraph()` in `jsroot-plot.svelte`
2. Update `plot.md` spec: add font-size lines to the JSROOT Integration code block and a new AC item
3. Correct the "legend top-right" contradiction in the redesign plan; mark 7.2 ✅
4. Create progress record `docs/progress/stage-7.2.md`
5. Verify with `pnpm test`

### Prompt 2: Create a branch for this task and commit your work. Add detailed AI log according to needed specification in this project.

**AI response**: Created branch `feature/7.2-jsroot-plot-styling-polish`, wrote this AI log, updated `docs/ai-logs/README.md`, and committed all changes.

## Tasks

### Stage 7.2 — Implement explicit 14 pt-equivalent font sizes

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: 7.2 — JSROOT plot styling polish
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/lib/components/jsroot-plot.svelte`
- **Decision**: Used `0.04` as the NDC font-size value for both label and title sizes on both axes. In ROOT/JSROOT, font sizes are specified as a fraction of the pad height. `0.04 × 500 px × (1 pt / 1.333 px) ≈ 15 pt` at a ~500 px canvas (the midpoint of the `min(60vh, 600px)` range). This matches the standard ROOT physics-plot convention and approximates the "14 pt" target in the redesign plan.
- **Issue**: JSROOT NDC font sizes are not pixel-exact across all canvas heights. At the min (400 px) the effective size is ~12 pt; at max (600 px) ~18 pt. This is inherent to ROOT's NDC font model and cannot be solved without a resize observer that redraws on every size change — which would be disproportionate complexity for a cosmetic requirement. `0.04` is the accepted physics-community convention.

### Stage 7.2 — Update plot.md spec with font-size requirement

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: 7.2
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/04-feature-specs/plot.md`
- **Decision**: Added the font-size lines directly to the existing `buildMultigraph()` code block in the JSROOT Integration section, so spec and implementation stay in sync as a single source of truth. Added one AC item under "JSROOT Canvas": `fLabelSize = fTitleSize = 0.04 NDC`.

### Stage 7.2 — Resolve redesign plan contradiction and mark complete

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: 7.2
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/00-redesign-plan.md`
- **Decision**: The redesign plan note "legend top-right" conflicted with `plot.md`'s AC. Since `plot.md` is the authoritative spec, the redesign plan note was updated to reflect the correct behavior (no canvas legend, series list serves as legend). Status changed ⏳ → ✅.

### Stage 7.2 — Progress record and changelog

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: 7.2
- **Files changed**:
  - `docs/progress/stage-7.2.md` (new)
  - `docs/ai-logs/2026-05-13-stage7-2-jsroot-plot-styling-polish.md` (this file, new)
  - `docs/ai-logs/README.md`
  - `CHANGELOG-AI.md`

### Prompt 3: Visual inspection showed JSROOT defaults look better — revert font sizes, update spec and docs

**AI response**: Reverted the `fLabelSize`/`fTitleSize` override in `buildMultigraph()`. Updated `plot.md` spec (removed font-size lines from code block; updated AC to document that JSROOT defaults are intentionally used). Updated `docs/00-redesign-plan.md` notes and `docs/progress/stage-7.2.md` with the finding. Appended to this log.

### Stage 7.2 — Revert explicit font sizes after visual inspection

- **Status**: completed
- **Stage**: 7.2
- **Files changed**:
  - `src/lib/components/jsroot-plot.svelte` — removed `fLabelSize`/`fTitleSize` lines
  - `docs/04-feature-specs/plot.md` — removed font-size override from code block; AC updated to "JSROOT defaults, no explicit override"
  - `docs/00-redesign-plan.md` — task 7.2 note updated to reflect visual-inspection finding
  - `docs/progress/stage-7.2.md` — font-size section rewritten with outcome
- **Decision**: The `0.04` NDC override inflated labels visually relative to the canvas and the surrounding UI. JSROOT's built-in defaults are more balanced. The "14 pt" guideline in the redesign plan was aspirational; the visual result is the actual acceptance criterion. No `fLabelSize`/`fTitleSize` is set — this is a deliberate, documented choice, not an oversight.
