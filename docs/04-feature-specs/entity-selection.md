# Feature: Entity Selection (Particle → Material → Program)

> **Status:** Final v6 (15 April 2026 — Stage 2.6 amendments)
>
> Covers the entity selection component used on both the
> Calculator and Plot pages. This is the primary interaction point
> for choosing _what_ to calculate.
>
> **v2 changes:** Reversed the visual and logical order from Program-first
> to Particle → Material → Program. Added bidirectional filtering via a
> compatibility matrix. Added support for "program-first" workflow via
> independent unselect. See [libdedx#79](https://github.com/APTG/libdedx/issues/79)
> for user feedback motivating this change.
>
> **v3 changes:** Adopted always-visible scrollable list panels (inspired by
> [`libdedx_demo.html`](https://github.com/APTG/libdedx/issues/79#issuecomment-4158280966))
> instead of dropdown comboboxes. Unavailable items are
> greyed out rather than hidden. Material panel split into two independently
> scrollable sub-lists (Elements / Compounds) sharing one text filter.
>
> **v4 changes:** Split into two layout modes: **full panel mode** (Plot page,
> sidebar with always-visible lists) and **compact mode** (Calculator page,
> inline dropdown comboboxes). Adopted Alternative A layout with narrower
> de-emphasized Program panel. Added UX rationale citing progressive disclosure,
> Fitt's Law, and context-appropriate density. Shared state persists across
> page navigation.
>
> **v5:** Marked as final after cross-review with calculator.md,
> 06-wasm-api-contract.md, and 01-project-vision.md. No changes needed.
>
> **Terminology:** The libdedx C library uses the term "ion" everywhere —
> including for the electron (ID 1001) — even though calling an electron an
> "ion" is physically incorrect. This is a legacy naming convention in the C
> API (functions like `dedx_fill_ion_list`, `dedx_get_ion_name`, etc.).
>
> In **dedx_web** and in all web-app specs we use the correct term
> **"particle"** (or "charged particle") to refer to any projectile:
> protons, alpha particles, heavy ions, and electrons. The TypeScript type
> is `ParticleEntity`. The C API's "ion" naming is confined to the WASM
> wrapper layer that directly calls C functions.
>

## User Story

**As a** radiation physicist,
**I want to** first choose my particle (like proton, alpha particle, heavy ion
or electron) and target (material, like Silicon), then see which stopping-power
programs can serve that combination,
**so that** I follow the natural mental model of a physics experiment: pick the
beam, pick the target, _then_ pick the data source — rather than memorizing
which programs exist.

**As a** data quality researcher,
**I want to** select a specific program first, then see which particles and materials
it covers,
**so that** I can audit data availability per database.

## Compatibility Matrix

### Why it is needed

The libdedx C API exposes only program-centric queries:
`dedx_fill_ion_list(program)` and `dedx_fill_material_list(program)`.
There is no reverse lookup (e.g., "which programs support Carbon on Water").
See [libdedx#79](https://github.com/APTG/libdedx/issues/79) — a native
`dedx_get_programs_for_ion_material()` function is requested but not yet
available. Until it is, the frontend must derive valid combinations itself.

### How it is built

At WASM init time, the service iterates over every program returned by
`getPrograms()` and calls `getParticles(programId)` + `getMaterials(programId)`
for each. The results are stored in an in-memory compatibility matrix:

```typescript
/**
 * Pre-computed at init. Enables O(1) lookups in any direction:
 *   "which programs support particle X?" / "which materials does program P have?"
 *   / "which programs support particle X + material Y?"
 */
interface CompatibilityMatrix {
  /** programId → Set of particle IDs supported by that program. */
  particlesByProgram: Map<number, Set<number>>;
  /** programId → Set of material IDs supported by that program. */
  materialsByProgram: Map<number, Set<number>>;
  /** particleId → Set of program IDs that support this particle. */
  programsByParticle: Map<number, Set<number>>;
  /** materialId → Set of program IDs that support this material. */
  programsByMaterial: Map<number, Set<number>>;
  /** All known particles (union across all programs). */
  allParticles: ParticleEntity[];
  /** All known materials (union across all programs). */
  allMaterials: MaterialEntity[];
  /** All known programs. */
  allPrograms: ProgramEntity[];
}
```

The matrix is built once (< 20 programs × ~120 particles × ~280 materials per
program = manageable). The data is static for the lifetime of the page.

> **Performance note**: Building the matrix requires ~20 `getParticles()` +
> ~20 `getMaterials()` calls at init. These are synchronous in-memory
> lookups into the compiled WASM data tables, expected to complete in < 100 ms
> total. If profiling shows otherwise, the matrix can be built lazily on
> first use of each program.

| Property                | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type                    | Always-visible scrollable list panel with text filter input                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Data source             | Derived from `CompatibilityMatrix.allParticles`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Display format          | `Name (Symbol)` — e.g., "Carbon (C)". The chemical symbol comes from `ParticleEntity.symbol`. For Electron: "Electron". The atomic number Z is **not shown** in the label; it remains a search keyword so users can type "z=6" or "6" to find Carbon.                                                  |
| Search aliases          | Match on `name`, `symbol`, `aliases` (e.g., “proton” → Hydrogen, “alpha” → Helium), atomic number Z, mass number A                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Default                 | **Proton** (Hydrogen, Z=1) — highlighted on page load                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Available / unavailable | All particles are always shown. Particles incompatible with the current material+program selection are **greyed out** (reduced opacity, non-interactive). Compatible particles are shown at full contrast.                                                                                            |
| Selected state          | The selected particle has a **dark background highlight** (accent colour) with white text. Clicking a selected particle deselects it (toggle).                                                                                                                                                        |
| Special                 | Particle ID 1001 = Electron — always present in the particle list but **always greyed out** (ESTAR is not implemented in libdedx v1.4.0; `dedx.c:587` returns `DEDX_ERR_ESTAR_NOT_IMPL` for all calculations). Show a tooltip on hover: _"Electron stopping powers not available in libdedx v1.4.0."_ |
| Clearable               | Yes — clicking the selected item again toggles it off, or a clear (×) button in the panel header                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### 2. Material Selector (second — middle)

The material selector is **wider** than the other two panels because it
contains a split layout with two independently scrollable sub-lists.

| Property                | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Type                    | Always-visible **split panel**: one shared text filter on top, two side-by-side scrollable sub-lists below ("Elements" on the left, "Compounds" on the right)                                                                                                                                                      |
| Data source             | Derived from `CompatibilityMatrix.allMaterials`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Display format          | `Name` — e.g., "Water (liquid)". The numeric material ID is **not shown** in labels or triggers; it remains available as a search keyword so users can still type "276" to find water. Names are sourced from `dedx_get_material_friendly_name()` (local C wrapper in `wasm/dedx_extra.{h,c}`) which applies title-case and a human-friendly override table (e.g., "WATER" → "Water (liquid)", "WATERVAPOR" → "Water Vapor"). |
| Search                  | A single text filter input at the top filters **both** sub-lists simultaneously. Match on `name`, material ID (numeric, e.g. "276" finds Water), common aliases (e.g., "water" → "Water (liquid)"). The ID is a search keyword only — it is not shown in the label.                                                |
| Default                 | **Water (liquid)** (ID 276) — highlighted on page load                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Available / unavailable | All materials are always shown. Materials incompatible with the current particle+program selection are **greyed out** (reduced opacity, non-interactive). Compatible materials shown at full contrast.                                                                                                             |
| Selected state          | Dark background highlight with white text (same style as particle/program). Toggle off by clicking again.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Split layout            | **Elements** (material IDs 1–98, i.e. pure chemical elements) in the left sub-list, sorted by ID (= atomic number). **Compounds** (IDs 99–278 + 906 Graphite, i.e. mixtures, tissues, plastics, etc.) in the right sub-list, sorted alphabetically by name. Each sub-list has its own independent scroll position. |
| Special                 | Gas-default materials (29 entries) shown with a gas indicator icon/badge                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Clearable               | Yes — click selected item to toggle off, or clear (×) button in the panel header                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### 3. Program Selector (last — bottom / right)

| Property                | Detail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Descriptions come from `getProgramDescription()` in `src/lib/config/program-names.ts`. The raw version string from `dedx_get_program_version()` is kept in `searchText` but not displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Default                 | **“Auto-select”** — a virtual entry at the top, always available, resolves to the best ICRU dataset for the current particle/material (see §4.3 of 01-project-vision.md)                                                                                                    |
| Hidden programs         | **`DEDX_ICRU`** (ID 9) is **excluded** from the program panel. Its function is entirely covered by "Auto-select"; showing both would confuse users. The compatibility matrix still uses `DEDX_ICRU` internally for resolution, but it never appears as a selectable option. |
| Available / unavailable | All _visible_ programs are always shown. Programs incompatible with the current particle+material selection are **greyed out**. “Auto-select” is never greyed out.                                                                                                          |

## Behavior

### Bidirectional Filtering

Unlike v1, there is **no single root selector**. All three selectors filter
each other bidirectionally via the compatibility matrix:

```
Particle ←→ Material ←→ Program
 ↑                    ↑
 └────────────────────┘
```

When any selector changes, the available options in the other two selectors
are recomputed. The filtering logic is:

```typescript
// Pseudocode for deriving available options:
function getAvailablePrograms(particle?: number, material?: number): ProgramEntity[] {
  let candidates = matrix.allPrograms;
  if (particle != null) {
    const progs = matrix.programsByParticle.get(particle);
    candidates = candidates.filter((p) => progs?.has(p.id));
  }
  if (material != null) {
    const progs = matrix.programsByMaterial.get(material);
    candidates = candidates.filter((p) => progs?.has(p.id));
  }
  return candidates;
}

function getAvailableParticles(program?: number, material?: number): ParticleEntity[] {
  let candidates = matrix.allParticles;
  if (program != null) {
    const particles = matrix.particlesByProgram.get(program);
    candidates = candidates.filter((i) => particles?.has(i.id));
  }
  if (material != null) {
    // particles that share at least one program with this material
    const materialProgs = matrix.programsByMaterial.get(material);
    candidates = candidates.filter((i) => {
      const particleProgs = matrix.programsByParticle.get(i.id);
      return particleProgs && materialProgs && [...particleProgs].some((p) => materialProgs.has(p));
    });
  }
  return candidates;
}

// getAvailableMaterials is symmetric to getAvailableParticles
```

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **On WASM init (page load):**
   - Fetch all programs via `getPrograms()`.
   - For each program, fetch particles and materials to build the `CompatibilityMatrix`.
   - Insert a synthetic **"Auto-select"** entry at the top of the program list
     (this is a frontend construct, not from libdedx).
   - Set defaults: Particle = Proton (ID 1), Material = Liquid Water (ID 276),
     Program = "Auto-select".
   - Compute available options for each selector based on defaults.

2. **User changes particle (typical first step):**
   - Update the selected particle.
   - Recompute available materials: only materials that share at least one
     program with the new particle.
   - Recompute available programs: only programs that support the new particle
     (and the current material, if one is selected).
   - **Preserve current material** if it is still in the available list.
     Otherwise, fall back to Liquid Water if available, else the first material.
   - **Preserve current program** if still compatible. Otherwise, reset to
     "Auto-select".
   - Show a brief notification if material or program was changed
     (e.g., "PSTAR does not support Carbon; program reset to Auto-select").
   - If the selected particle is a proton (`massNumber === 1`) or electron
     (ID 1001), the energy unit selector should show only “MeV”.
     For heavy ions (`massNumber > 1`), show “MeV” and “MeV/nucl”.
     See `docs/04-feature-specs/unit-handling.md` for the full rules.

3. **User changes material (typical second step):**
   - Update the selected material.
   - Recompute available particles: only particles that share at least one program with
     the new material.
   - Recompute available programs: only programs that support the new material
     (and the current particle, if one is selected).
   - **Preserve current particle** if still available. Otherwise, fall back to
     Proton if available, else the first particle.
   - **Preserve current program** if still compatible. Otherwise, reset to
     "Auto-select".
   - Show notification if particle or program was auto-changed.

4. **User changes program (typical third step, or "program-first" workflow):**
   - Update the selected program.
   - Recompute available particles: only particles supported by the new program (and
     compatible with the current material, if set).
   - Recompute available materials: only materials supported by the new program
     (and compatible with the current particle, if set).
   - **Preserve current particle** if still available. Otherwise, fall back to
     Proton if available, else the first particle.
   - **Preserve current material** if still available. Otherwise, fall back to
     Liquid Water if available, else the first material.
   - Show notification for any auto-changed selections.

5. **User clears particle (unselects):**
   - Remove the particle filter.
   - Recompute available materials and programs based only on the remaining
     selections (material and/or program).
   - The material and program lists expand to show all compatible options.
   - The program selection is preserved. This allows the "program-first"
     workflow: select a program, clear the particle, and see all available
     particles/materials for that program.

6. **User clears material (unselects):**
   - Symmetric to clearing particle. Programs and particles recalculated without
     material constraint.

7. **Auto-select program resolution (display):**
   - When "Auto-select" is active, after any particle or material change, resolve
     the concrete program that would be used for the current combination.
   - Display the resolved program name, e.g., _"Auto-select → ICRU 49"_.
   - Resolution uses `DEDX_ICRU` internally; the resolution chain is:
     - Proton: ICRU 49 → PSTAR
     - Alpha: ICRU 49 → ASTAR
     - Carbon: ICRU 73 → ICRU 73 (old) → MSTAR
     - Other heavy ions: ICRU 73 → ICRU 73 (old)
     - Electron (ID 1001): N/A — ESTAR not implemented in libdedx v1.4.0;
       Electron is permanently greyed out and cannot be used in calculations
       > [!NOTE]
       > **Runtime note (libdedx v1.4.0):** wireframes below still show
       > `"Auto-select → ICRU 90"` as historical aspirational text, but runtime data
       > currently does not contain ICRU 90 (`data/wasm_runtime_stats.json`).
       > The highest runtime ICRU dataset is ICRU 49 (id=7), so proton/alpha
       > Auto-select resolves through ICRU 49 first.
   - Future: a webdedx-level auto-selection layer may extend this (e.g., prefer
     MSTAR for specific heavy-ion/material combos). This is out of scope for v1
     but the data model should not preclude it.

### "Program-first" Workflow (Reverse Order)

Users may also want to explore data availability per program. This workflow
is supported without any mode toggle:

1. Clear particle and material (or start fresh).
2. Select a specific program (e.g., MSTAR).
3. The particle list shows only particles MSTAR supports. The material list shows
   only materials MSTAR supports.
4. Select a particle from the filtered list → material list narrows further.
5. Select a material → ready to calculate.

This is the reverse of the default flow but uses the same bidirectional
filtering logic. The visual order (Particle → Material → Program) remains
constant — only the user's interaction order changes.

### Text Filter Behavior

Each panel has a text filter input above its scrollable list(s):

- Typing filters the list in real time (case-insensitive substring match).
- For the material panel, the single filter applies to **both** the Elements
  and Compounds sub-lists simultaneously.
- Matching text in the results is **not** hidden — non-matching items are
  hidden, but greyed-out (unavailable) items that match the filter remain
  visible in their greyed-out state. This lets users see that an item exists
  but is currently incompatible.
- If the filter matches zero items in a list, show "No results" in that list.
- Clearing the filter input restores the full list.
- Arrow keys navigate the visible (non-hidden) items; Enter selects; Escape
  clears the filter text.
- The filter input has a small clear (×) icon when non-empty.

### Selection & Deselection Behavior

- **Clicking an available item** selects it (dark background highlight).
- **Clicking the currently selected item** deselects it (toggle behaviour),
  removing that entity's filtering constraint from the other panels.
- **Clicking a greyed-out item** does nothing (pointer events disabled).
- When an entity is deselected, other panels immediately recalculate which
  items are available/greyed-out based on the remaining selections.
- The Program panel has no explicit deselect — deselecting always returns
  to "Auto-select".
- A "Reset all" link above the panels clears all selections back to defaults
  (Proton / Liquid Water / Auto-select).

### Greyed-Out (Disabled) Items

Unavailable items are shown **greyed out** in-place rather than hidden:

- Reduced opacity (~0.4) and `pointer-events: none`.
- They maintain their position in the list so the layout doesn't jump.
- This communicates _what exists_ in libdedx even when it's not compatible
  with the current selection — useful for discoverability.
- The text filter can still match greyed-out items (they remain visible
  but non-interactive).

> **Rationale:** The demo (`libdedx_demo.html`) showed that greying out
> items works well even for the ~280-item material list. Users can see the
> full data landscape and understand why certain items are unavailable.

### Search Matching Rules

| Entity   | Searchable fields                                                                                                                                 |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Program  | `name`, `description`, `version` (version kept for search only, not displayed)                                                                    |
| Particle | `name`, `aliases` (e.g., "proton", "alpha", "deuteron", "electron"), `Z` (atomic number as string), `A` (mass number as string; N/A for Electron) |
| Material | `name`, `id` (as string), common aliases                                                                                                          |

For particles, the `aliases` field from `ParticleEntity` provides human-friendly names:

| Particle ID | Name     | Aliases        |
| ----------- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1           | Hydrogen | proton, p, H-1 |
| 2           | Helium   | alpha, α, He-4 |
| 6           | Carbon   | C-12           |
| 1001        | Electron | e⁻, e-, beta   |

> The alias list is a frontend configuration, not from libdedx. It should be
> defined as a static lookup table in `src/lib/config/particle-aliases.ts`.

### Loading States

- While WASM is initializing and the compatibility matrix is being built,
  all entity selectors show a loading skeleton/spinner.
- If WASM init fails, show an error banner with a retry button. Entity
  selectors are disabled.

> **Note:** After init, all filtering is done in-memory against the
> compatibility matrix. There are no subsequent async fetches when the user
> changes a selector — the UI updates synchronously.

### Error States

| Error                                                                                | Handling                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WASM init failure                                                                    | Error banner, all selectors disabled, retry button                                              |
| Compatibility matrix contains a program with zero particles or materials             | Omit that program from `allPrograms` (data issue in libdedx, not actionable by user)            |
| Previously selected particle/material unavailable after a change in another selector | Auto-fall-back + notification                                                                   |
| All three selectors cleared to a state with zero compatible programs                 | Show inline warning: "No program supports this combination" (should not happen with valid data) |

---

## Output

The entity selection component does not produce user-visible output on its own.
It provides the **selected state** to parent components (Calculator, Plot):

```typescript
interface EntitySelectionState {
  /** The selected program (or the "Auto-select" virtual entry). */
  program: ProgramEntity | AutoSelectProgram;
  /** The resolved program ID for C API calls (always a real program ID). */
  resolvedProgramId: number;
  /** The selected particle (proton, heavy ion, or electron), or null if cleared. */
  particle: ParticleEntity | null;
  /** The selected material, or null if cleared. */
  material: MaterialEntity | null;
  /**
   * True when all three selections are made and the combination is valid
   * for calculation. Parent components should disable "Calculate" / "Plot"
   * buttons when this is false.
   */
  isComplete: boolean;
  /** Available options for each selector given the current constraints. */
  availablePrograms: ProgramEntity[];
  availableParticles: ParticleEntity[];
  availableMaterials: MaterialEntity[];
}

/** The synthetic "Auto-select" program entry. */
interface AutoSelectProgram {
  id: -1; // sentinel value, never sent to C API
  name: "Auto-select";
  /** The concrete program it resolves to for the current particle/material. */
  resolvedProgram: ProgramEntity | null; // null when particle or material is cleared
}
```

This state is exposed via Svelte 5 `$props` / `$bindable` or a shared runes-based
store (architecture TBD in `docs/03-architecture.md`).

---

## UI Layout

### Design Rationale — Two Layout Modes

The entity selection component is used on both the Calculator and Plot pages,
but the **primary activity** on each page is different:

| Page           | Primary activity                                 | Entity selection role                    | Screen budget                           |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Calculator** | Enter energy values, read numeric results        | Setup (done once, then mostly stable)    | Shared with energy input + result table |
| **Plot**       | Explore data: add/compare series, inspect curves | Repeated (new series = new entity combo) | Shared with the JSROOT canvas           |

**UX best practices applied:**

- **Context-appropriate density** (Nielsen Norman Group): exploration views
  (Plot) benefit from persistent, always-visible controls; task-completion
  views (Calculator) benefit from focused input→output flow.
- **Fitt's Law**: on the Calculator page the energy input is the most frequent
  target, so entity selectors should not dominate. On the Plot page, entity
  selection is the frequent target (adding series), so it deserves permanent
  real estate.
- **Progressive disclosure** (§4.4 of project vision): the Calculator shows
  a compact selector by default; the Plot shows full panels because
  exploration _is_ the task.
- **F-pattern scanning**: entity selection (setup) on the left; output
  (results/plot) on the right or center — matching the natural reading flow.

The component therefore has **two layout modes** consuming the same underlying
`EntitySelectionState` and `CompatibilityMatrix`:

| Mode            | Used on         | Layout                                          |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Full panels** | Plot page       | Always-visible scrollable list panels (sidebar) |
| **Compact**     | Calculator page | Searchable dropdown comboboxes (inline form)    |

Both modes share all behavior described in the Behavior section above
(bidirectional filtering, greying out, preserve/fallback, Auto-select
resolution). Only the visual presentation differs.

### Visual Order (both modes)

The selectors always appear in this order, reflecting the natural physics
workflow (beam → target → data source):

1. **Particle** (projectile)
2. **Material** (target)
3. **Program** (data source / database)

Users are free to interact with them in any order. The visual order is a
hint, not an enforcement.

---

### Full Panel Mode (Plot Page)

Used on the **Plot page** where entity selection is a repeated, exploratory
activity. The panels live in a **left sidebar**; the JSROOT plot canvas
occupies the remaining right-hand space.

#### Panel Style

Each panel is a **card** with:

- A header: numbered label (e.g., “① Particle”), accent colour.
- A text filter input below the header.
- A scrollable list body (fixed height, ~400px on desktop, adapts on mobile).
- A rounded border, subtle shadow, white background.

The selected item has a **dark accent background** (`#0d7377` or Tailwind
equivalent) with white text. Greyed-out items use `opacity: 0.4`.

> Design reference: `libdedx_demo.html` — the card + list + filter + highlight
> pattern from that prototype is the target aesthetic.

#### Desktop (≥900px) — Sidebar + Canvas

The page is split into a **sidebar** (entity selection + "Add Series" button)
and a **main area** (plot canvas + series list).

The sidebar uses a **two-column layout for Particle + Material** with the
**Program panel below, narrower** — reflecting that most users never change
the program (Alternative A layout):

```

- Page grid: `grid-template-columns: minmax(360px, 3fr) 7fr`.
- Inside the sidebar, Particle and Material are in a **sub-grid row**:
  `grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr` — Particle takes ~⅓, Material takes ~⅔
  (it has two sub-lists).
- The Program panel spans the full sidebar width below Particle+Material but
  has a **shorter list height** (~150px) since there are only ~10 programs.
  This de-emphasizes it visually.
- The sidebar is scrollable if the viewport is too short for all three panels.

### Compact Mode (Calculator Page)

Used on the **Calculator page** where the primary activity is entering
energy values and reading results. Entity selection is a "configure once"
step — most users pick Proton + Water and only change the energy.

#### Design Principles

- **Minimal vertical footprint**: entity selectors are a single horizontal
  row of comboboxes, not tall panels.
- **Center-stage results**: the result table and/or key numeric output
  (e.g., CSDA range) is prominently centered, not pushed to a sidebar.
- **Same data, different chrome**: the compact selectors use the same
  `CompatibilityMatrix`, bidirectional filtering, and Auto-select logic.
  Greyed-out items appear in the dropdown lists but are non-interactive.

#### Selector Widgets

Each entity selector is a **searchable dropdown combobox**:

- A single-line input showing the current selection (e.g., "Hydrogen (H)").
- Clicking or focusing opens a dropdown panel with a filtered list.
- Typing in the input filters the dropdown (same matching rules: aliases,
  Z, A, name, ID).
- Item styling in the dropdown matches the full panel mode: available items
  at full contrast, unavailable items greyed out.
- Material dropdown shows "Elements" and "Compounds" as section headers
  within the single dropdown list (not two columns — too narrow).
- Program dropdown shows the resolved label inline:
  `Auto-select → ICRU 49` as the default display value.

ARIA: `role="combobox"`, `aria-expanded`, `aria-activedescendant`,
`role="listbox"` on the dropdown, `role="option"` on items,
`aria-disabled="true"` on greyed-out items.

#### Desktop (≥900px) — Centered form layout

```

- Max content width ~720px, centered horizontally (`mx-auto`).
- Entity selectors in a **single three-column grid row** (`grid-cols-3`): Particle,
  Material, and Program each occupy one column. All three are always visible without
  wrapping on desktop. The Energy unit selector lives in the energy input row below.
- Program combobox is **narrower** than Particle/Material (~180px vs ~240px)
  because it is less frequently changed — visual hierarchy via width.
- The unified input/result table is the visual centerpiece, full content width.
  Energy is typed in the first column; results appear inline in the same row.

#### Tablet (600–899px)

Same as desktop but at full viewport width (no centering margin).
All four selector items may wrap to two rows.

#### Mobile (<600px)

Entity selectors stack vertically, each full width:

```

### Switching Between Modes

The two layout modes are **not runtime-switchable** by the user. They are
determined by the page route:

- `/calculator` → compact mode
- `/plot` → full panel mode

Both modes bind to the same shared `EntitySelectionState` store. If the
user selects "Carbon" on the Calculator page, navigates to the Plot page,
the Plot page shows Carbon pre-selected in the full panel. Similarly,
the URL encodes the selection identically for both pages (see
`shareable-urls.md`).

---

## Accessibility

- Each panel has a visible heading (`<h2>` or `<label>`) associated with its list.
- The text filter input has `role="searchbox"` and `aria-controls` pointing to
  the list(s) it filters. For the material panel, `aria-controls` references
  both sub-lists.
- Each scrollable list has `role="listbox"`; each item has `role="option"`.
- Greyed-out items have `aria-disabled="true"`.
- The selected item has `aria-selected="true"`.
- Arrow keys navigate the visible (non-hidden) items within a focused list;
  Enter selects; Escape clears the filter text.
- Screen readers announce the number of available (non-greyed) results
  (e.g., "3 of 12 particles available").
- Color is not the sole indicator for gas-default materials (icon + text badge).
- Greyed-out state is communicated via both opacity and `aria-disabled`,
  not colour alone.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Layout & Panels — Full Panel Mode (Plot Page)

- [ ] Three panels are displayed in the sidebar: Particle, Material, Program — in that visual order.
- [ ] On desktop (≥900px), Particle and Material are in a sub-grid row (1fr + 2fr); Program spans full sidebar width below, with shorter list height (~150px).
- [ ] The sidebar takes ≈30% of the page width; the JSROOT canvas takes ≈70%.
- [ ] On tablet (600–899px), the sidebar folds above the canvas; panels stack horizontally then canvas below.
- [ ] On mobile (<600px), all panels stack vertically; material sub-lists remain side-by-side.
- [ ] The Material panel contains two independently scrollable sub-lists: Elements (IDs 1–98) and Compounds (IDs 99+).
- [ ] Each sub-list has a sticky group header ("Elements" / "Compounds").

### Layout — Compact Mode (Calculator Page)

- [ ] Entity selectors are searchable dropdown comboboxes in a horizontal flex row.
- [ ] Particle and Material comboboxes are wider (~240px) than Program (~180px) — visual hierarchy.
- [ ] On desktop, the form is centered (max-width ~720px) with the result table as visual centerpiece.
- [ ] On mobile (<600px), comboboxes stack vertically at full width.
- [ ] Material dropdown shows Elements and Compounds as section headers within a single dropdown list.

### Shared State

- [ ] Both modes share the same `EntitySelectionState` store; selection persists across page navigation.
- [ ] Layout mode is determined by page route, not a user toggle.

### Defaults & Init

- [ ] On page load, entity selectors populate from WASM data within 2 seconds (after WASM init).
- [ ] Default state is Proton / Water (liquid) / Auto-select with no user interaction required.
- [ ] The compatibility matrix is built at init from all programs' particle/material lists.

### Bidirectional Filtering

- [ ] Selecting a particle greys out incompatible materials and programs.
- [ ] Selecting a material greys out incompatible particles and programs.
- [ ] Selecting a program greys out incompatible particles and materials.
- [ ] Greyed-out items have reduced opacity (~0.4) and are non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`).
- [ ] Greyed-out items remain in their original list position (no layout shift).
- [ ] Deselecting (toggling off) an entity removes its filtering constraint; other panels update immediately.

### Preserve / Fallback

- [ ] Changing a selector preserves the current selections in other panels if they remain compatible.
- [ ] If a previously selected particle or material becomes incompatible, the selector falls back to the default (Proton / Water) if available, else the first available entry, and a notification is shown.

### Text Filter

- [ ] Typing in any panel's filter input filters that panel's list with case-insensitive substring matching.
- [ ] The Material panel's single filter input filters both Elements and Compounds sub-lists simultaneously.
- [ ] Particle filter matches on name, aliases ("proton", "alpha"), Z, A, and chemical symbol.
- [ ] Material filter matches on name and numeric ID.
- [ ] Greyed-out items that match the filter remain visible (greyed out, not hidden).
- [ ] Non-matching items are hidden from view.

### Selection UX

- [ ] Clicking an available item selects it with a dark accent background and white text.
- [ ] Clicking the selected item again deselects it (toggle).
- [ ] Clicking a greyed-out item does nothing.
- [ ] The "Auto-select" program displays the resolved concrete program name (e.g., "Auto-select → ICRU 49").
- [ ] Resolved program updates when particle or material changes while "Auto-select" is active.
- [ ] A "Reset all" link restores defaults (Proton / Water / Auto-select).

### Program Panel

- [ ] Programs are grouped into "Tabulated data" and "Analytical models" with labelled dividers.
- [ ] "Auto-select" is always shown at the top and never greyed out.
- [ ] `DEDX_ICRU` (ID 9) is **not** shown in the program panel; its function is covered by "Auto-select".
- [ ] The resolved program label uses frontend-enriched names (e.g., "ICRU 49") not raw C library names (e.g., "ICRU").

### Keyboard & Accessibility

- [ ] Each panel is keyboard-navigable (Tab to filter, Arrow keys to navigate list, Enter to select, Escape to clear filter).
- [ ] ARIA attributes: `role="listbox"`, `role="option"`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `role="searchbox"` on filters.
- [ ] Screen readers announce available item counts.
- [ ] Loading state is shown while WASM initializes.
- [ ] Error state with retry is shown if WASM init fails.

### Special Cases

- [ ] Electron (particle ID 1001) appears in the particle list but is always greyed out (ESTAR not implemented in libdedx v1.4.0). A tooltip on hover reads "Electron stopping powers not available in libdedx v1.4.0."
- [ ] Gas-default materials are visually indicated with an icon and text badge, not colour alone.

## Open Questions

1. **Auto-select resolution visibility:** Should the resolved program be shown
   only as a subtle label, or also as a tooltip on the program selector?
   _Current decision: subtle label below the program list inside the panel._

2. ~~**Material grouping**~~ **Resolved.** Materials are split into two
   side-by-side sub-lists (Elements / Compounds) with a shared text filter.
   Each sub-list scrolls independently.

3. **Panel scroll height:** ~400px on desktop, ~300px on tablet, ~200px on
   mobile. Exact values to be refined during implementation.
   _Inspired by `libdedx_demo.html` which uses `height: 400px`._

4. **Graphite (ID 906):** This is a special allotrope of Carbon (element 6)
   with its own material ID. Should it appear in the Elements sub-list
   (alongside Carbon) or in the Compounds sub-list? The demo places it at
   the end of the full list.
   _Current decision: place in Compounds sub-list (ID ≥ 99 rule), with a
   note "(allotrope of Carbon)" in the display name._

5. **Sort order within Elements sub-list:** By atomic number (= material ID)
   or alphabetically? _Current decision: by ID (= atomic number), matching
   periodic table order, as in the demo._
